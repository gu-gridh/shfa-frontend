# Overview
This repository is for the Svenskt Hällristningsforskningsarkiv frontend, an interface for searching and viewing rock art documentation.  The backend is a Django-based solution developed by GRIDH, and the repository for it is [here](https://github.com/gu-gridh/shfa).  The frontend also has a multimodal viewer for meshes, the details of which are [here](https://github.com/gu-gridh/multimodal-viewer).

This project is developed for SHFA and is managed by Siska Humlesjö. Additional developers attached to the project are Tristan Bridge, Aram Karimi, Jonathan Westin, and Ashely Green. The Django-based application has been developed and is maintained by Aram Karimi. The public frontend of SHFA includes a multimdodal viewer, a Node.js application built with Express developed by GRIDH for visualizing and interacting with meshes, pointclouds, RTI, and IIIF images. Both the SHFA frontend and multimodal viewer were developed by Tristan Bridge and Jonathan Westin.
